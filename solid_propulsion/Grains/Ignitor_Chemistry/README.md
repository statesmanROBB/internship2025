# Thermochemical Characterization of KFBP Ignitor

## Getting started

Welcome. This directory contains a description of the thermochemical properties of a custom ignitor made of scrap $KNO_3$ + Sorbitol + $Fe_2O_3$ & Black powder. We go into the details from its ignition characteristics to a microstructure and defect analysis. You can get started by visiting the `doc` directory and interacting with the Jupyter notebook (`ignitor_chemistry.ipynb`) there.

## Contributors

The list will be updated as people add on to the documentation.
