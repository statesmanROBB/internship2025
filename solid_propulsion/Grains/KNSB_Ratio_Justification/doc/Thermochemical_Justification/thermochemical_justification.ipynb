    "We justified the optimal KNSB ratio i.e. $65\\%:35\\%$, as it provides a high specific impulse with efficient combustion, *indicated by $I_{sp}$ and $C^*$*, while maintaining safe thermal characteristics and physical integrity. It is a well-characterized formulation that makes it a reliable and practical choice for our SRM."
